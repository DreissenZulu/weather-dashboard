# Unit 06 Server-Side APIs Homework: Weather Dashboard
A weather dashboard which displays current weather and forecast for a searched city. Users can search for a city, and if found the app will return the current weather, as well as a forecast of the next 5 days. The user's search history is saved as a button for them to quickly check the weather of that city again.

## Approach
I started by dividing the main task into smaller tasks, as outlined below:
1. Get the user input city
2. Send the request to the Openweather server and retrieve the current weather and forecast
3. Show the information on screen
4. Create a button that does the same thing as steps 2 and 3 for the weather in that city again

In this approach I started with a functionality focus first, then I worked on the styling. Or well, that's what I'd like to say but I ended up developing the HTML/CSS skeleton first anyway.
